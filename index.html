	      <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>My Android app has been live in Google Play for 6 months, but I'm still encountering strange bugs and behaviours, making big mistakes, and learning surprising things. The latest surprise has come with a recent flush of ICS users who's devices are putting more significant demands on my handling of the Activity lifecycle, specifically with relation to managing state.</p>

<p>tl:dr; - beware when invoking <code>startActivityForResult</code> that onActivityResult is invoked <em>before</em> onResume!</p>

<p>Before I get to the problems, lets have a quick look at the Activity lifecycle. I'm going to "borrow" google's lifecycle diagram:</p>

<p><img src="http://developer.android.com/images/activity_lifecycle.png" alt="Android Activity Lifecycle" /></p>

<p>Some important things to remember here are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apps typically consist of <em>multiple</em> Activity's, and <em>each</em> Activity follows the above lifecycle while your app is running.</li>
<li>When your Activity starts a <em>child</em> Activity (with <code>startActivity</code> or <code>startActivityForResult</code>), both the <code>onPause</code> and <code>onStop</code> lifecycle methods of the parent Activity <em>should</em> be called, in that order.</li>
<li>When an Activity is invoked <em>as</em> a child Activity, its lifecycle will be completed by the time the parent Activity is fully in control again (at least <code>onCreate</code>, <code>onStart</code>, <code>onResume</code>, and <code>onPause</code> will have been invoked).</li>
<li>Your Activity can be killed off <em>at any time</em> after its <code>onPause</code> has completed, without necessarily passing through <code>onStop</code> or <code>onDestroy</code>. It is critically important to remember that <em>this includes situations where your Activity is on the back-stack waiting for a result from a child Activity, or even when it is still visible but mostly covered by a dialog!</em></li>
</ul>

<p>With regard to the last point its worth familiarising yourself with <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals/processes-and-threads.html">the way Android manages Processes</a>.</p>

<h2>State, and the Application object</h2>

<p>One simple way, you might think, to manage state without worrying too much about the <code>Activity</code> lifecycle is to use the Application object. Android allows you to specify your own class (<code>extends Application</code>), which your Activity's can access through <code>getApplication</code>.</p>

<p>That's nice. It needs care though, since the process that your Application object lives in can be killed and restarted at (perhaps) unexpected junctures. Take this scenario:</p>

<ol>
<li>App A starts with Activity A1, which sets up some state in the Application object.</li>
<li>Activity A1 starts Activity A2, which uses the state in the Application object.</li>
<li>Activity A2 fires an <code>Intent</code> for Activity B1 of App B and expects some result (lets say we fired an <code>Intent</code> asking for an image to be captured by the camera app).</li>
<li>App B starts, and launches Activity B1.</li>
<li>Activity B1 is memory-heavy, so <em>the system shuts down App A (completely kills its process), even though it is on the back-stack waiting for a result</em>.</li>
<li>Activity B1 returns, app A's Application object is created, Activity A2 is started again but Activity A1 never launched in the lifetime of this Application object so <em>does not get the opportunity to set up the state of the Application object</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The sequence diagram might look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5ObK6-kJmEw/T99trhVZyCI/AAAAAAAAKRU/70rljFQPRKE/s800/sequence-diagram.png" alt="seuqence diagram" /></p>

<p>Clearly, if Activity A2 relies on A1 having run first to set up the application state, there's going to be trouble as soon as A2 starts trying to access that state after resuming from B2. <em>If you're going to use the Application object to manage state, make sure that it is set up as part of the Application's own lifecycle methods</em>.</p>

<p>Now, the gotcha that's been hurting me is this: I assumed that onActivityResult would be invoked <em>after</em> onResume. Turns out this is not the case, and in fact onActivityResult was getting called long before my state was re-initialised in onResume. </p>

<p>On my devices I never suffered from this because my process was not being killed and the state was still present in memory at the point when onActivityResult was invoked!</p>

              <a itemprop="url" href="testing_android_apps.html"><h1 itemprop="name" itemprop="headline">Testing Android apps</h1></a>
	      <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>I've been developing an Android app as a spare-time project for 6 months now. I have access to 3 Android devices:</p>

<ul>
<li>Samsung Galaxy SII running ICS (my personal mobile)</li>
<li>Samsung Galaxy Mini running Gingerbread (bought as a temporary dev device when my old HTC Desire gave up the ghost)</li>
<li>Motorola Xoom II Media Edition (tablet used for day job)</li>
</ul>

<p>My app runs beautifully on all these devices. I <em>cannot</em> make it crash. It really frustrates me that I get crash reports from other devices and cannot replicate them. For a spare-time project I can't afford to buy lots of devices to test with. Enter <a href="http://www.appthwack.com/">AppThwack</a>.</p>

<h2>AppThwack</h2>

<p>I first heard about AppThwack after I tweeted about one of its competitors - testdroid - trying to find some testimonials from other users. I didn't find any, but I did get a reply from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/tdpeterson">@tdpeterson</a> inviting me to AppThwack's beta.</p>

<p>Some weeks later I finally found a spare few minutes to take a look, and I'm so glad I did!</p>

<p>As they are currently in beta, you need a code to be able to sign up. Mine arrived a few hours after requesting it, and I immediately signed up to give it a try. The service makes it very easy to get started, which is clever, because once you're in you really are hooked - its just too good.</p>

<h3>Chaos Monkeys</h3>

<p>I uploaded the latest release apk I had to hand and launched the UI Exerciser Monkey tests (these are automatic and randomised tests that poke all the buttons and what-not). From sign-up to running tests took less than 2 minutes.</p>

<p><img style="float:right; margin:25px;" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-C3vMO8EpKjY/T9I13xsV1VI/AAAAAAAAKQs/v83alvoNCYo/s288/tmpBxqtro.png"></p>

<p>The monkeys found at least two bugs that I was not aware of on that first run. I am torn between horror and delight. The horror and delight turn to embarassment when I realise that I have uploaded an obfuscated apk, and the stack-traces are in gibberese. Lesson#1 right there.</p>

<p>A test run takes a while to complete, but you can watch the results coming in in real time. When you realise what is going on behind the scenes its really impressive: your app is installed, launched, monkeyed, and then uninstalled <em>simultaneously across a whole farm of different devices</em> running different versions of Android. I'd love to see what that looks like :)</p>

<p>You can view the results of your test runs in a number of different ways. I like the "issues by device" mode, which lists all the devices that experienced problems or warnings, and allows you to drill down to see what happened in the monkey log - with a full stack trace of the crash - and then down again into log-cat.</p>

<p>Pause a second and let that sink in. I just ran my app on 43 different devices and Android versions in under 5 mins and now I have instant access to the stack traces from the crashing devices and <em>the full log-cat output</em>. I even get screen-shots from some of the devices - above is from an HTC Evo 4G running 2.3.3. Holy shitcakes!</p>

<p>Oh, and you can filter the log-cat output directly in the web-app. Nice.</p>

<p><img style="margin-left:100px;" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_CnnB9TOWeo/T9I7XwlEiKI/AAAAAAAAKRA/Yw3bRzhhmWU/s400/Screen%2520Shot%25202012-06-08%2520at%252018.45.54.png"></p>

<h3>Programmed Tests</h3>

<p>OK, now I have some crashes that I want to try to replicate which are going to involve some complex interactions. Its going to take a lot of chaos monkeys a long time to replicate those tests, but the AppThwack guys have thought of that and integrate Robotium testing too.</p>

<p>Robotium was also new to me, but again its a great tool and a doddle to get started: </p>

<ol>
<li>download the robotium jar from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/robotium/downloads/list">here</a></li>
<li>create an Android test project, set up to test "this" project (<em>not</em> the project you actually want to test)</li>
<li>set the manifest &lt;instrumentation&gt; tag's targetPackage attribute to be the package of the app you want to test</li>
<li>copy the basic test code from <a href="http://robotium.googlecode.com/files/TestAndroidapkfileUsingRobotium.pdf">this tutorial</a> (I confess I find it weird that the tutorial is a pdf, not a web page!)</li>
<li>tweak the test code to test your app - its a very straight-forward API</li>
<li>Run the app you want to test in an emulator</li>
<li>Run your test and watch as it drives your app in the emulator - great fun</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have a working test that you want to run over at AppThwack's device farm its really easy to get that going too:</p>

<ol>
<li>export a signed apk of the app you want to test (app-under-test)</li>
<li>export a signed apk of the test project (sign with the same key!)</li>
<li>upload app-under-test apk</li>
<li>click the configure icon</li>
<li>click "add test apk", and upload the test project apk</li>
<li>click go</li>
<li>marvel as the results start rolling in</li>
</ol>

<h3>Early days</h3>

<p>I haven't really tried to fix my crashing bugs yet, but at least there is light at the end of the tunnel now, thanks to AppThwack and Robotium.</p>

<p>I noticed a few funnies along the way, which I plan to mention to the AppThwack guys when I've had a bit more experience:</p>

<ul>
<li>Many devices crashed at the same point, but there's no way to collapse common issues together - I found myself opening the log for each device to check the stack-traces to find out the total number of different problems. <em>update: Pawel from AppThwack tells me a new view mode "By Failure" is in the works and will be landing in the beta very soon!)</em></li>
<li>Some devices timed out while installing. I'm not sure if this is a problem with my app (seems unlikely?) or some issue with the devices themselves? Its not a catastrophe if its a device problem, but then probably they should be marked as warnings rather than errors. <em>update: Pawel confirmed there were timeouts within the device-farm which I'm sure they'll resolve soon</em></li>
<li>I noticed lots of these in the monkey logs: <code>java.io.FileNotFoundException: /mnt/sdcard/scriptlog.txt (Permission denied)</code> which seem to be just noise (at least as far as I am concerned)</li>
</ul>

<p>So far so wonderful as far as I'm concerned: my thanks to Trellis Automation for AppThwack, and I really hope the beta goes well and the business is successful! </p>

	      <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>I haven't blogged in a while. I've been very busy with lots of different things, but nothing sufficiently technical and juicy to write about. Some less techy and more entrepreneurial adventures have been floating around, so I though to make some notes on those.</p>

<p>Things have taken a strange turn at work, with a very ambitious new project in the pipeline that is quite a departure from our usual business. I am tasked to deliver both development-wise <em>and</em> in terms of defining the business model. </p>

<p>The development alone will be a monumental task. Defining a business model is &hellip; quite some way outside my experience. The budget is almost non-existent. The time-scales are horribly short. I'm not even sure I completely buy the basic premise of the project. And yet &hellip; it is still a strangely attractive prospect, and its all Eric Ries' fault.</p>

<h3>The Lean Startup</h3>

<p><a style="float:left; margin:25px;" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0670921602/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stlibl-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=06709216020"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ASIN=0670921602&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=stlibl-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822"></a></p>

<p>In September last year I read Eric Reis' excellent book - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0670921602/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stlibl-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=06709216020">The Lean Startup</a> - and was inspired to put it into practice on my personal projects. I stopped getting hung up on the infinite details of feature-complete perfection, and started thinking in terms of Minimum Viable Product.</p>

<p>It led me to release my first ever solo "for profit" work, a super-simple <a href="http://www.overpayment-calculator.com/">mortgage repayment calculator</a>. </p>

<p>The development part was fun, and I got an excuse to use one of my <a href="http://steveliles.github.com/mortgage_loan_overpayment_calculator.html">open-source libraries</a>. </p>

<p>What turned out to be really interesting though, was that to get it online I had to register a domain-name and figure out how to <a href="http://steveliles.github.com/pointing_a_domain_name_to_an_amazon_s3_bucket.html">point it at an Amazon S3 bucket</a>, which I had to <a href="http://steveliles.github.com/hosting_a_static_website_in_amazon_s3.html">configure to host a website</a>. Two things I'd never done before. </p>

<p>I also spent time researching keywords, used multiple landing pages on different sub-domains with different keyword content, and set up analytics to see which gets most traffic - following Eric's advice to scientifically test a theory.</p>

<p>For my second project I had a bit more time - I had a week off in the run-up to Christmas to use up my 2011 vacation entitlement. My wife was working, which meant I had a guilt-free coding week (my wife is great about me coding at home, but it doesn't stop me feeling guilty).</p>

<p><a style="float:right; margin:25px;" href=""><img src="https://lh5.ggpht.com/xOyfv0sgk1SUn_BYDKDUJoXb8ZkpKQrZSql4O7fFAJZsDB3MHB3AX265-9LMirlkDg=w124"></a></p>

<p>I used the time to introduce myself properly to Android and build upon a little idea that I'd had. It started out by me wanting to use comic-book style pictures of myself on my blog to represent topics. </p>

<p>I had spent time working on some java code to take a bitmap and process it to resemble an SVG. From there it wasn't much of a leap to try to make an app that lets you build comic strips from your photos, and so <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.roundwoodstudios.comicstripit">Comic Strip It!</a> was born on Christmas Eve, 2011.</p>

<p>It really was a minimum viable product. The feature set of release 1.0 was:</p>

<ul>
<li>add photos to your comic strip, in 350x350 pixel frames</li>
<li>zoom and rotate photos to fit the frames</li>
<li>the comic strip would be laid out automatically in blocks of 3 frames across</li>
<li>add a caption below each frame</li>
<li>set a title for the comic strip</li>
<li>share the comic strip (email/twitter/facebook/etc - Android made this super-easy to do)</li>
</ul>

<p>I've added many features since, as directed by user feedback. Much of best feedback has come from people who emailed me directly with suggestions, especially in the early days, but some of the real kickers have come from disgruntled commenters. </p>

<p>In the spirit of Lean Startup experimentation I launched two versions - starting with the free version as described above then, in early january, a paid version that included speech balloons.</p>

<p>I've learned so much about people, product development/marketing/monetisation, and myself from having an app out there in the wild with no barrier between me and the users! My main problem now is finding a block of time to work on accelerating the growth of the user base.</p>

<h3>More Experiments</h3>

<p>Given the lack of a decent block of time to work on the app, I've spent a little time here and there on a couple of new, small, experiments. These aren't really MVP's as such, but they are in the spirit of Lean Startup.</p>

<h4>www.tribyute.com</h4>

<p><a style="float:left; margin:25px;" href="http://www.tribyute.com"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-w48tKzKVVgQ/T9DnorMq8eI/AAAAAAAAKQY/rI1RXv-8eXM/s200/tribyute.com.png"></a></p>

<p>The first is a <a href="http://www.tribyute.com/">teaser website</a> for an idea I had about expressing admiration for people you know, in such a way that over time an online character reference builds up, and the recipient gets an occasional boost when someone praises them.</p>

<p>The point here was just to test if there was any interest in the idea by asking people to leave their email to get notified later when the service goes live.</p>

<p>No ideas really about how to monetise it, but that wasn't the point of this one, it was just an idle thought that expressing admiration like that would be a nice thing to be able to do.</p>

<p>I registered a domain and pointed it at an app-engine web-app, thrown together with some simple html and css and a servlet. All in all just a few hours work. Its only just started to appear in google searches, so too early to say how the experiment will pan out.</p>

<h4>Zazzle t-shirts</h4>

<div style="float:right; text-align:center;line-height:150%"> <a href="http://www.zazzle.co.uk/sleep_tees-235809889333236460?gl=roundwood&rf=238286102792357014"> <img src="http://rlv.zcache.co.uk/sleep_tees-rf3ca96555d9547a692dee0727df16340_f0czi_325.jpg" alt="sleep tees" style="border:0;" /></a></div>

<p>The second experiment is something quite different. For some work-related research I'd been reading about affiliate-marketing. </p>

<p>I was aware of the Amazon affiliate system (indeed the book links on my blog are affiliate links), but I hadn't really considered that it was a common practice til now. </p>

<p>Zazzle's affiliate system allows anyone to set up a "store" under the main zazzle website, and populate it with their own products. </p>

<p>These products are customised versions of the products that zazzle themselves sell - ie. t-shirts, hoodies, decorated mugs, etc. You even get to set your own level of commission on each product. You can see one of my designs here :)</p>

<p>Zazzle help with tools for marketing your products too, but because its so easy <em>lots</em> of people have set up stores, and there's lots of competition. For me its really just a fun experiment, and a chance to do a bit of art work, so its all good really.</p>

<h3>Conclusion, sort of</h3>

<p><a style="float:left; margin:25px;" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0091929113/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stlibl-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0091929113"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ASIN=0091929113&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=stlibl-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" ></a></p>

<p>My main point throughout all this waffle is probably this: Stop trying to do something and do it! Create the smallest possible version of your product that can deliver value, release it, and use scientific measurement to direct your efforts for what to do next.

This is how it looks:</p>

<div style="width:590px; height:300px;" id="sax_dsl4xml_chart_div"></div>

<p>Notice that while it loses about 15% on raw SAX parsing, it still provides approximately an order of magnitude greater throughpout than the next best (raw pull parsing). And of course, its damn easy to write <em>readable</em> unmarshalling code with :)</p>

<p>I also added SimpleXML parsing to my performance tests - it ties for last place (performance-wise) with W3C DOM parsing. Arguably it is more readable and requires less code than the others, though personally I'm not a huge fan.</p>

	      <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>I'm so fed up with the Google Play comments and rating system. How can they have got it so wrong? Comments and user-ratings are a bad system to start with, but Google's system is broken beyond belief.</p>

<h3>Comment/Rating is a broken idea</h3>

<p>Commenting and rating systems are a bad idea to begin with. They pander to the extremes no matter what the subject under comment.</p>

<p>Check any app - <em>any app</em> - on the market: I defy you to find <em>one</em> that is not overwhelmingly rated 1 or 5 stars. Why? Because most people between the two extremes don't care enough or can't be bothered to rate an app.</p>

<p>That leaves the big fans who love the apps unquestionably but, bless 'em, unhelpfully ("&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; Love this app"), and the haters ("&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734; Gross! sucks! don't download!").</p>

<p>The big fans are wonderful, but not helpful, but neither are they being destructive. The haters though, they really get to me. I <em>want</em> my apps to be good. I <em>want</em> them to work for everyone. I <em>want</em> them to be liked. I feel it <em>really personally</em> when my app gets a bad rating. I shouldn't, everyone tells me, but I can't help it - I'm invested in my work.</p>

<p>I've put a lot of time and effort into this thing - poured myself into it. A lot of that time I've given away free. Gratis. No charge. The "pro" version is the price of a newspaper that you'd read once and throw away.</p>

<p>If you download, don't like, &#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734; and walk away, I'm stuck with a bad rating that I can do <em>nothing</em> about, and its cost you <em>nothing</em> (Google Play allows a refund within a couple of hours of the download). </p>

<p>Please don't misunderstand me - I'm not railing against the people who comment and rate negatively - everyone is entitled to an opinion. The problem is the system which Google have created seems designed to make life difficult for app developers, and frustrating for users.</p>

<p>Negative commenters seem to fall into a few categories:</p>

<h4>The Unwittingly Unhelpful</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734; <em>N. O'Tunreasonable</em> on April 20th, 2012 (Motorola shit-hot-superphone-II with version 2.0.1)</p>
  
  <p>"Doesn't work on Motorola shit-hot-superphone-II. FIX IT OR REFUND ME!".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dude, I'd love to fix it. No really, I would! Ask any one of the dozen or so people who've emailed or tweeted me about a problem and who got a response within hours and a fix within two days at most (best I can do on a personal project - I have a day job!).</p>

<p>Unfortunately I don't have a Motorola shit-hot-superphone-II (its always Motorola, why is that? Oh, occasionally its an HTC, but nearly always Motorola. Curse them). </p>

<p>It works great on my Samsung's, including the Galaxy mini that cost £50 in Tesco. No new crash reports or freezes in my developer console. How in the living hells do you expect me to FIX IT or, for that matter, to refund you? <em>I do not know who you are</em> because Google anonymise you!</p>

<p>I don't blame these guys actually - they rightly expect the app to work, and equally they expect a commenting system to allow some kind of conversation. Unfortunately, the Android eco-system is fragmented to hell and back, bugs are a universal truth of software, and Play's commenting system does not allow threaded responses and does not give the developer access to the commenters identity.</p>

<p>The first two I can handle - fragmentation requires more work, and bugs can be fixed, but I <em>need</em> to be able to communicate with commenters or I can't help them. I'm looking at you Google. With beetled brows.</p>

<h4>The Blackmailer</h4>

<p>Uses the power of a bad rating to demand whatever features he feels the app should have before benificently conferring his generous 5 stars.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734; <em>Dick Dastardly</em> on April 16th, 2012 (HTC Wonderful with version 2.0.1)</p>
  
  <p>"Great app, will rate 5* when you add XYZ feature"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really, this has happened to me several times. Luckily so far the "requests" have been for features I was already working on, so I've managed to satisfy these without having to bow to any whims. Strangely they do get all gushy afterwards.</p>

<h4>The Affronted</h4>

<p>Affronted that after skipping the description and reading just the name and maybe glancing at the icon of the app, it turns out not to do what they wanted - the confusion thus engendered renders the app's very existence <em>a personal insult</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734; <em>D. Idnot RTFM</em> on April 16th, 2012 (Samsung Universe XVI with version 2.0.1)</p>
  
  <p>"I ecspected this app to XXX but it dusnt it only YYY sooooo ridicolus OMFG I waisted nerly 30 seconds of my life on this thing and then I culdnt make it XXX but it shoud and like whatever this sux, dont waist ur life on this"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, nothing much I an do about that, except try to come up with a better name / more descriptive icon / shorter and more pointed description. I guess I just have to hope that other potential downloaders do read the app description and take these kinds of comments with a pinch of salt. </p>

<h4>The Cryptic Critic</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734; on April 16th, 2012 (HTC Wonderful with version 2.0.1)</p>
  
  <p>"Shocking. So baaad. Even the icons suck. WTF!?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, come on guys! Shocking how? What's bad? Why do the icons suck? Give us a frigging clue here! There must have been something about the app that tempted you to download (unless I've mislabelled one of The Affronted), so presumably the issues with the app could have been worked out.</p>

<p>Except Google didn't give me the chance to help you, or to improve the app for those that come after, because I have <em>no way</em> to answer the comment, publicly or privately, or to try to get any further information from the complainant.</p>

<h2>Options for Developers on Google Play</h2>

<h3>Build great apps</h3>

<p>OK, this one sounds obvious, but its hard to build a great app on the first shot without any helpful feedback. </p>

<p>As a solo developer its especially hard, actually, to see your own mistakes and evaluate the quality of something when you are so close to the work. If you have a company or a team working on an app there are lots of eyes and minds to spot mistakes, find bugs, and think of improvements.</p>

<p>There are a few things we could do as developers, but I'm not sure of the efficacy of these strategies: </p>

<ul>
<li>Build diagnostics into our own apps - crash reports are very very useful, but miss a lot of vital information (Android version!? Heap size on <em>all</em> memory errors!?). We either have to wait for Google to make improvements or DIY it.</li>
<li>Build feedback into our own apps - ask the user to submit feedback from within the app, and record and publish that feedback on the developers website. Doesn't solve the problem of comments on the Google market, but <em>might</em> make it possible to engage in a conversation with a percentage of the users you would otherwise be unable to talk to.</li>
<li>Switch allegiance to Amazon's store. Of course, then you have to pay a fee to join, and are subject to an Apple-like review process, and I've no idea if the result is worth it - do Amazon solve any of the problems with Google's market?</li>
<li>Build our own market that does a better job. No seriously, I'd love to do this. Of course, its a massive undertaking, and would require an incredible confluence of circumstances (or marketing budget) to really take off.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Self comment</h3>

<p>On my free app I added a comment of my own, and I periodically freshen it up so it stays near the top of the stack so new commenters see it. Here's what it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; steve on March 10, 2012 (Samsung Galaxy S2 with version 1.5.4)
  I am the developer...</p>
  
  <p>Hi all! Please consider contacting me before leaving a negative review - I am very keen to improve the app, will fix reported bugs quickly, and will add popularly requested features! </p>
  
  <p>If you only leave a comment like "forces close" I can't fix it because it doesn't give me any info to work with - that makes me sad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I five-starred my own app. I don't feel bad actually, because how else can I contend with Google's broken ratings/comment system?</p>

<p>Unfortunately I'm not allowed to buy my own paid app, so this technique doesn't work there. I have added more or less the same information in the app description but, as we know, not everyone reads the descriptions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please please, if you have any problems at all contact us directly by email - crash reports and comments are great but Google don't give us any way to contact you back!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be fair, many (paying) users have emailed me, as has one person who wanted the app but couldn't download either free or paid versions on her device (apparent Market bug! I sent her the paid app for free and contacted the device manufacturer - Samsung - as there's no clear way to contact Google).</p>

<p>Sometimes when I've had negative comments from paying users I've been able to contact them by matching up the purchase record with the information in the comment. </p>

<p>I can't always match them up, but when I can they are never surprised that I was able to contact them. They <em>expect</em> that commenting makes their information available to the developer. Why wouldn't it?</p>

<h3>Mark as spam</h3>

<p>The only tool Google give developers to deal with comments is a spam/not-spam toggle. I don't think its appropriate to mark genuine comments (and I do think all of the above are genuine comments) as spam.</p>

<p>I understand this tool was added some time ago because there were big spam problems. So far I didn't get any spam comments at all.</p>

<h3>Paid vs Free</h3>

<p>Strangely, the users of paid apps are typically much more polite and less inclined to negatively review. They are more often inclined to email for help and delighted to get a response. </p>

<p>Could be its the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=principle%20of%20commitment&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CDcQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsumitdhar.blogspot.com%2F2005%2F09%2Finfluence-techniques-commitment.html&amp;ei=AhNET9KDG9OJhQfjl8XnBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8lIgMAPaBaWA2A1-D09qravE6Ew">Principle of Commitment</a> and maybe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-purchase_rationalization">Post-purchase Rationalisation</a> at work? Or maybe its just the demographic of free vs paid users?</p>

<p>I'm strongly considering never publishing a free app again, just for the reduced hassle.</p>

<h2>What Google can do to help developers</h2>

<p>I don't pretend to have all the answers, but a few small things would make my life as an Android developer much easier:</p>

<ul>
<li>Give developers access to the email address of commenters, or even a way to contact them via Google that keeps them anonymous. I imagine Google think that they are protecting users by anonymising them, but its really not helping anyone.</li>
<li>Allow threaded comments. That would be enough - if I could respond, and the commenter was alerted to the response, an awful lot of problems and misunderstandings could be cleared up quickly. This would be massively to Google's benefit, reducing user and developer frustration!</li>
<li>Include more device info in crash reports and comments (e.g. Android build versions and heap size for starters)</li>
<li>Maintain a list of device specs or emulator configurations that can be used to replicate crashes or bugs reported by users - including things like the damn heap size. I can't afford to buy one of every device on the market - my developer console states "This application is available to over 1245 devices.".</li>
</ul>

<p>Please Google, please just help us to help our users. Help us to make the Android eco-system better. Help us to generate more profits for you. Everyone wins.</p>

<p><em>p.s. I found a <a href="http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/android-market/feature-requests--suggestions/Ks4Eyg-UnpA">product-forums thread</a> on this topic where the originating comment dates back to May 2009 and raises many of the same points I've raised here. Clearly Google's priorities lie elsewhere :(</em></p>
