              <span class="meta" itemprop="datePublished"><time datetime="2012-06-08">June 08, 2012</time></span>
              <a itemprop="url" href="testing_android_apps.html"><h1 itemprop="name" itemprop="headline">Testing Android apps</h1></a>
	      <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>I've been developing an Android app as a spare-time project for 6 months now. I have access to 3 Android devices:</p>

<ul>
<li>Samsung Galaxy SII running ICS (my personal mobile)</li>
<li>Samsung Galaxy Mini running Gingerbread (bought as a temporary dev device when my old HTC Desire gave up the ghost)</li>
<li>Motorola Xoom II Media Edition (tablet used for day job)</li>
</ul>

<p>My app runs beautifully on all these devices. I <em>cannot</em> make it crash. It really frustrates me that I get crash reports from other devices and cannot replicate them. For a spare-time project I can't afford to buy lots of devices to test with. Enter <a href="http://www.appthwack.com/">AppThwack</a>.</p>

<h2>AppThwack</h2>

<p>I first heard about AppThwack after I tweeted about one of its competitors - testdroid - trying to find some testimonials from other users. I didn't find any, but I did get a reply from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/tdpeterson">@tdpeterson</a> inviting me to AppThwack's beta.</p>

<p>Some weeks later I finally found a spare few minutes to take a look, and I'm so glad I did!</p>

<p>As they are currently in beta, you need a code to be able to sign up. Mine arrived a few hours after requesting it, and I immediately signed up to give it a try. The service makes it very easy to get started, which is clever, because once you're in you really are hooked - its just too good.</p>

<h3>Chaos Monkeys</h3>

<p>I uploaded the latest release apk I had to hand and launched the UI Exerciser Monkey tests (these are automatic and randomised tests that poke all the buttons and what-not). From sign-up to running tests took less than 2 minutes.</p>

<p><img style="float:right; margin:25px;" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-C3vMO8EpKjY/T9I13xsV1VI/AAAAAAAAKQs/v83alvoNCYo/s288/tmpBxqtro.png"></p>

<p>The monkeys found at least two bugs that I was not aware of on that first run. I am torn between horror and delight. The horror and delight turn to embarassment when I realise that I have uploaded an obfuscated apk, and the stack-traces are in gibberese. Lesson#1 right there.</p>

<p>A test run takes a while to complete, but you can watch the results coming in in real time. When you realise what is going on behind the scenes its really impressive: your app is installed, launched, monkeyed, and then uninstalled <em>simultaneously across a whole farm of different devices</em> running different versions of Android. I'd love to see what that looks like :)</p>

<p>You can view the results of your test runs in a number of different ways. I like the "issues by device" mode, which lists all the devices that experienced problems or warnings, and allows you to drill down to see what happened in the monkey log - with a full stack trace of the crash - and then down again into log-cat.</p>

<p>Pause a second and let that sink in. I just ran my app on 43 different devices and Android versions in under 5 mins and now I have instant access to the stack traces from the crashing devices and <em>the full log-cat output</em>. I even get screen-shots from some of the devices - above is from an HTC Evo 4G running 2.3.3. Holy shitcakes!</p>

<p>Oh, and you can filter the log-cat output directly in the web-app. Nice.</p>

<p><img style="margin-left:100px;" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_CnnB9TOWeo/T9I7XwlEiKI/AAAAAAAAKRA/Yw3bRzhhmWU/s400/Screen%2520Shot%25202012-06-08%2520at%252018.45.54.png"></p>

<h3>Programmed Tests</h3>

<p>OK, now I have some crashes that I want to try to replicate which are going to involve some complex interactions. Its going to take a lot of chaos monkeys a long time to replicate those tests, but the AppThwack guys have thought of that and integrate Robotium testing too.</p>

<p>Robotium was also new to me, but again its a great tool and a doddle to get started: </p>

<ol>
<li>download the robotium jar from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/robotium/downloads/list">here</a></li>
<li>create an Android test project, set up to test "this" project (<em>not</em> the project you actually want to test)</li>
<li>set the manifest &lt;instrumentation&gt; tag's targetPackage attribute to be the package of the app you want to test</li>
<li>copy the basic test code from <a href="http://robotium.googlecode.com/files/TestAndroidapkfileUsingRobotium.pdf">this tutorial</a> (I confess I find it weird that the tutorial is a pdf, not a web page!)</li>
<li>tweak the test code to test your app - its a very straight-forward API</li>
<li>Run the app you want to test in an emulator</li>
<li>Run your test and watch as it drives your app in the emulator - great fun</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have a working test that you want to run over at AppThwack's device farm its really easy to get that going too:</p>

<ol>
<li>export a signed apk of the app you want to test (app-under-test)</li>
<li>export a signed apk of the test project (sign with the same key!)</li>
<li>upload app-under-test apk</li>
<li>click the configure icon</li>
<li>click "add test apk", and upload the test project apk</li>
<li>click go</li>
<li>marvel as the results start rolling in</li>
</ol>

<h3>Early days</h3>

<p>I haven't really tried to fix my crashing bugs yet, but at least there is light at the end of the tunnel now, thanks to AppThwack and Robotium.</p>

<p>I noticed a few funnies along the way, which I plan to mention to the AppThwack guys when I've had a bit more experience:</p>

<ul>
<li>Many devices crashed at the same point, but there's no way to collapse common issues together - I found myself opening the log for each device to check the stack-traces to find out the total number of different problems. <em>update: Pawel from AppThwack tells me a new view mode "By Failure" is in the works and will be landing in the beta very soon!)</em></li>
<li>Some devices timed out while installing. I'm not sure if this is a problem with my app (seems unlikely?) or some issue with the devices themselves? Its not a catastrophe if its a device problem, but then probably they should be marked as warnings rather than errors. <em>update: Pawel confirmed there were timeouts within the device-farm which I'm sure they'll resolve soon</em></li>
<li>I noticed lots of these in the monkey logs: <code>java.io.FileNotFoundException: /mnt/sdcard/scriptlog.txt (Permission denied)</code> which seem to be just noise (at least as far as I am concerned)</li>
</ul>

<p>So far so wonderful as far as I'm concerned: my thanks to Trellis Automation for AppThwack, and I really hope the beta goes well and the business is successful! </p>

	      <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>I haven't blogged in a while. I've been very busy with lots of different things, but nothing sufficiently technical and juicy to write about. Some less techy and more entrepreneurial adventures have been floating around, so I though to make some notes on those.</p>

<p>Things have taken a strange turn at work, with a very ambitious new project in the pipeline that is quite a departure from our usual business. I am tasked to deliver both development-wise <em>and</em> in terms of defining the business model. </p>

<p>The development alone will be a monumental task. Defining a business model is &hellip; quite some way outside my experience. The budget is almost non-existent. The time-scales are horribly short. I'm not even sure I completely buy the basic premise of the project. And yet &hellip; it is still a strangely attractive prospect, and its all Eric Ries' fault.</p>

<h3>The Lean Startup</h3>

<p><a style="float:left; margin:25px;" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0670921602/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stlibl-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=06709216020"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ASIN=0670921602&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=stlibl-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822"></a></p>

<p>In September last year I read Eric Reis' excellent book - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0670921602/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stlibl-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=06709216020">The Lean Startup</a> - and was inspired to put it into practice on my personal projects. I stopped getting hung up on the infinite details of feature-complete perfection, and started thinking in terms of Minimum Viable Product.</p>

<p>It led me to release my first ever solo "for profit" work, a super-simple <a href="http://www.overpayment-calculator.com/">mortgage repayment calculator</a>. </p>

<p>The development part was fun, and I got an excuse to use one of my <a href="http://steveliles.github.com/mortgage_loan_overpayment_calculator.html">open-source libraries</a>. </p>

<p>What turned out to be really interesting though, was that to get it online I had to register a domain-name and figure out how to <a href="http://steveliles.github.com/pointing_a_domain_name_to_an_amazon_s3_bucket.html">point it at an Amazon S3 bucket</a>, which I had to <a href="http://steveliles.github.com/hosting_a_static_website_in_amazon_s3.html">configure to host a website</a>. Two things I'd never done before. </p>

<p>I also spent time researching keywords, used multiple landing pages on different sub-domains with different keyword content, and set up analytics to see which gets most traffic - following Eric's advice to scientifically test a theory.</p>

<p>For my second project I had a bit more time - I had a week off in the run-up to Christmas to use up my 2011 vacation entitlement. My wife was working, which meant I had a guilt-free coding week (my wife is great about me coding at home, but it doesn't stop me feeling guilty).</p>

<p><a style="float:right; margin:25px;" href=""><img src="https://lh5.ggpht.com/xOyfv0sgk1SUn_BYDKDUJoXb8ZkpKQrZSql4O7fFAJZsDB3MHB3AX265-9LMirlkDg=w124"></a></p>

<p>I used the time to introduce myself properly to Android and build upon a little idea that I'd had. It started out by me wanting to use comic-book style pictures of myself on my blog to represent topics. </p>

<p>I had spent time working on some java code to take a bitmap and process it to resemble an SVG. From there it wasn't much of a leap to try to make an app that lets you build comic strips from your photos, and so <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.roundwoodstudios.comicstripit">Comic Strip It!</a> was born on Christmas Eve, 2011.</p>

<p>It really was a minimum viable product. The feature set of release 1.0 was:</p>

<ul>
<li>add photos to your comic strip, in 350x350 pixel frames</li>
<li>zoom and rotate photos to fit the frames</li>
<li>the comic strip would be laid out automatically in blocks of 3 frames across</li>
<li>add a caption below each frame</li>
<li>set a title for the comic strip</li>
<li>share the comic strip (email/twitter/facebook/etc - Android made this super-easy to do)</li>
</ul>

<p>I've added many features since, as directed by user feedback. Much of best feedback has come from people who emailed me directly with suggestions, especially in the early days, but some of the real kickers have come from disgruntled commenters. </p>

<p>In the spirit of Lean Startup experimentation I launched two versions - starting with the free version as described above then, in early january, a paid version that included speech balloons.</p>

<p>I've learned so much about people, product development/marketing/monetisation, and myself from having an app out there in the wild with no barrier between me and the users! My main problem now is finding a block of time to work on accelerating the growth of the user base.</p>

<h3>More Experiments</h3>

<p>Given the lack of a decent block of time to work on the app, I've spent a little time here and there on a couple of new, small, experiments. These aren't really MVP's as such, but they are in the spirit of Lean Startup.</p>

<h4>www.tribyute.com</h4>

<p><a style="float:left; margin:25px;" href="http://www.tribyute.com"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-w48tKzKVVgQ/T9DnorMq8eI/AAAAAAAAKQY/rI1RXv-8eXM/s200/tribyute.com.png"></a></p>

<p>The first is a <a href="http://www.tribyute.com/">teaser website</a> for an idea I had about expressing admiration for people you know, in such a way that over time an online character reference builds up, and the recipient gets an occasional boost when someone praises them.</p>

<p>The point here was just to test if there was any interest in the idea by asking people to leave their email to get notified later when the service goes live.</p>

<p>No ideas really about how to monetise it, but that wasn't the point of this one, it was just an idle thought that expressing admiration like that would be a nice thing to be able to do.</p>

<p>I registered a domain and pointed it at an app-engine web-app, thrown together with some simple html and css and a servlet. All in all just a few hours work. Its only just started to appear in google searches, so too early to say how the experiment will pan out.</p>

<h4>Zazzle t-shirts</h4>

<div style="float:right; text-align:center;line-height:150%"> <a href="http://www.zazzle.co.uk/sleep_tees-235809889333236460?gl=roundwood&rf=238286102792357014"> <img src="http://rlv.zcache.co.uk/sleep_tees-rf3ca96555d9547a692dee0727df16340_f0czi_325.jpg" alt="sleep tees" style="border:0;" /></a></div>

<p>The second experiment is something quite different. For some work-related research I'd been reading about affiliate-marketing. </p>

<p>I was aware of the Amazon affiliate system (indeed the book links on my blog are affiliate links), but I hadn't really considered that it was a common practice til now. </p>

<p>Zazzle's affiliate system allows anyone to set up a "store" under the main zazzle website, and populate it with their own products. </p>

<p>These products are customised versions of the products that zazzle themselves sell - ie. t-shirts, hoodies, decorated mugs, etc. You even get to set your own level of commission on each product. You can see one of my designs here :)</p>

<p>Zazzle help with tools for marketing your products too, but because its so easy <em>lots</em> of people have set up stores, and there's lots of competition. For me its really just a fun experiment, and a chance to do a bit of art work, so its all good really.</p>

<h3>Conclusion, sort of</h3>

<p><a style="float:left; margin:25px;" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0091929113/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stlibl-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0091929113"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ASIN=0091929113&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=stlibl-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" ></a></p>

<p>My main point throughout all this waffle is probably this: Stop trying to do something and do it! Create the smallest possible version of your product that can deliver value, release it, and use scientific measurement to direct your efforts for what to do next. If nothing else you will learn so much!</p>

<p>If you are involved at some level in the development of products, buy <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0670921602/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stlibl-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=06709216020">The Lean Startup</a> - it will change how you think about product development. </p>

<p>While you're there, you might want to look at <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0091929113/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stlibl-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0091929113">The 4-hour work week</a>, which shattered lots of my illusions about how the world works, despite the fact that I don't like a fair number of the prescribed methods.</p>

This is how it looks:</p>

<div style="width:590px; height:300px;" id="sax_dsl4xml_chart_div"></div>

<p>Notice that while it loses about 15% on raw SAX parsing, it still provides approximately an order of magnitude greater throughpout than the next best (raw pull parsing). And of course, its damn easy to write <em>readable</em> unmarshalling code with :)</p>

<p>I also added SimpleXML parsing to my performance tests - it ties for last place (performance-wise) with W3C DOM parsing. Arguably it is more readable and requires less code than the others, though personally I'm not a huge fan.</p>

	      <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>I'm so fed up with the Google Play comments and rating system. How can they have got it so wrong? Comments and user-ratings are a bad system to start with, but Google's system is broken beyond belief.</p>

<h3>Comment/Rating is a broken idea</h3>

<p>Commenting and rating systems are a bad idea to begin with. They pander to the extremes no matter what the subject under comment.</p>

<p>Check any app - <em>any app</em> - on the market: I defy you to find <em>one</em> that is not overwhelmingly rated 1 or 5 stars. Why? Because most people between the two extremes don't care enough or can't be bothered to rate an app.</p>

<p>That leaves the big fans who love the apps unquestionably but, bless 'em, unhelpfully ("&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; Love this app"), and the haters ("&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734; Gross! sucks! don't download!").</p>

<p>The big fans are wonderful, but not helpful, but neither are they being destructive. The haters though, they really get to me. I <em>want</em> my apps to be good. I <em>want</em> them to work for everyone. I <em>want</em> them to be liked. I feel it <em>really personally</em> when my app gets a bad rating. I shouldn't, everyone tells me, but I can't help it - I'm invested in my work.</p>

<p>I've put a lot of time and effort into this thing - poured myself into it. A lot of that time I've given away free. Gratis. No charge. The "pro" version is the price of a newspaper that you'd read once and throw away.</p>

<p>If you download, don't like, &#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734; and walk away, I'm stuck with a bad rating that I can do <em>nothing</em> about, and its cost you <em>nothing</em> (Google Play allows a refund within a couple of hours of the download). </p>

<p>Please don't misunderstand me - I'm not railing against the people who comment and rate negatively - everyone is entitled to an opinion. The problem is the system which Google have created seems designed to make life difficult for app developers, and frustrating for users.</p>

<p>Negative commenters seem to fall into a few categories:</p>

<h4>The Unwittingly Unhelpful</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734; <em>N. O'Tunreasonable</em> on April 20th, 2012 (Motorola shit-hot-superphone-II with version 2.0.1)</p>
  
  <p>"Doesn't work on Motorola shit-hot-superphone-II. FIX IT OR REFUND ME!".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dude, I'd love to fix it. No really, I would! Ask any one of the dozen or so people who've emailed or tweeted me about a problem and who got a response within hours and a fix within two days at most (best I can do on a personal project - I have a day job!).</p>

<p>Unfortunately I don't have a Motorola shit-hot-superphone-II (its always Motorola, why is that? Oh, occasionally its an HTC, but nearly always Motorola. Curse them). </p>

<p>It works great on my Samsung's, including the Galaxy mini that cost £50 in Tesco. No new crash reports or freezes in my developer console. How in the living hells do you expect me to FIX IT or, for that matter, to refund you? <em>I do not know who you are</em> because Google anonymise you!</p>

<p>I don't blame these guys actually - they rightly expect the app to work, and equally they expect a commenting system to allow some kind of conversation. Unfortunately, the Android eco-system is fragmented to hell and back, bugs are a universal truth of software, and Play's commenting system does not allow threaded responses and does not give the developer access to the commenters identity.</p>

<p>The first two I can handle - fragmentation requires more work, and bugs can be fixed, but I <em>need</em> to be able to communicate with commenters or I can't help them. I'm looking at you Google. With beetled brows.</p>

<h4>The Blackmailer</h4>

<p>Uses the power of a bad rating to demand whatever features he feels the app should have before benificently conferring his generous 5 stars.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734; <em>Dick Dastardly</em> on April 16th, 2012 (HTC Wonderful with version 2.0.1)</p>
  
  <p>"Great app, will rate 5* when you add XYZ feature"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really, this has happened to me several times. Luckily so far the "requests" have been for features I was already working on, so I've managed to satisfy these without having to bow to any whims. Strangely they do get all gushy afterwards.</p>

<h4>The Affronted</h4>

<p>Affronted that after skipping the description and reading just the name and maybe glancing at the icon of the app, it turns out not to do what they wanted - the confusion thus engendered renders the app's very existence <em>a personal insult</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734; <em>D. Idnot RTFM</em> on April 16th, 2012 (Samsung Universe XVI with version 2.0.1)</p>
  
  <p>"I ecspected this app to XXX but it dusnt it only YYY sooooo ridicolus OMFG I waisted nerly 30 seconds of my life on this thing and then I culdnt make it XXX but it shoud and like whatever this sux, dont waist ur life on this"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, nothing much I an do about that, except try to come up with a better name / more descriptive icon / shorter and more pointed description. I guess I just have to hope that other potential downloaders do read the app description and take these kinds of comments with a pinch of salt. </p>

<h4>The Cryptic Critic</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734; on April 16th, 2012 (HTC Wonderful with version 2.0.1)</p>
  
  <p>"Shocking. So baaad. Even the icons suck. WTF!?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, come on guys! Shocking how? What's bad? Why do the icons suck? Give us a frigging clue here! There must have been something about the app that tempted you to download (unless I've mislabelled one of The Affronted), so presumably the issues with the app could have been worked out.</p>

<p>Except Google didn't give me the chance to help you, or to improve the app for those that come after, because I have <em>no way</em> to answer the comment, publicly or privately, or to try to get any further information from the complainant.</p>

<h2>Options for Developers on Google Play</h2>

<h3>Build great apps</h3>

<p>OK, this one sounds obvious, but its hard to build a great app on the first shot without any helpful feedback. </p>

<p>As a solo developer its especially hard, actually, to see your own mistakes and evaluate the quality of something when you are so close to the work. If you have a company or a team working on an app there are lots of eyes and minds to spot mistakes, find bugs, and think of improvements.</p>

<p>There are a few things we could do as developers, but I'm not sure of the efficacy of these strategies: </p>

<ul>
<li>Build diagnostics into our own apps - crash reports are very very useful, but miss a lot of vital information (Android version!? Heap size on <em>all</em> memory errors!?). We either have to wait for Google to make improvements or DIY it.</li>
<li>Build feedback into our own apps - ask the user to submit feedback from within the app, and record and publish that feedback on the developers website. Doesn't solve the problem of comments on the Google market, but <em>might</em> make it possible to engage in a conversation with a percentage of the users you would otherwise be unable to talk to.</li>
<li>Switch allegiance to Amazon's store. Of course, then you have to pay a fee to join, and are subject to an Apple-like review process, and I've no idea if the result is worth it - do Amazon solve any of the problems with Google's market?</li>
<li>Build our own market that does a better job. No seriously, I'd love to do this. Of course, its a massive undertaking, and would require an incredible confluence of circumstances (or marketing budget) to really take off.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Self comment</h3>

<p>On my free app I added a comment of my own, and I periodically freshen it up so it stays near the top of the stack so new commenters see it. Here's what it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; steve on March 10, 2012 (Samsung Galaxy S2 with version 1.5.4)
  I am the developer...</p>
  
  <p>Hi all! Please consider contacting me before leaving a negative review - I am very keen to improve the app, will fix reported bugs quickly, and will add popularly requested features! </p>
  
  <p>If you only leave a comment like "forces close" I can't fix it because it doesn't give me any info to work with - that makes me sad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I five-starred my own app. I don't feel bad actually, because how else can I contend with Google's broken ratings/comment system?</p>

<p>Unfortunately I'm not allowed to buy my own paid app, so this technique doesn't work there. I have added more or less the same information in the app description but, as we know, not everyone reads the descriptions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please please, if you have any problems at all contact us directly by email - crash reports and comments are great but Google don't give us any way to contact you back!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be fair, many (paying) users have emailed me, as has one person who wanted the app but couldn't download either free or paid versions on her device (apparent Market bug! I sent her the paid app for free and contacted the device manufacturer - Samsung - as there's no clear way to contact Google).</p>

<p>Sometimes when I've had negative comments from paying users I've been able to contact them by matching up the purchase record with the information in the comment. </p>

<p>I can't always match them up, but when I can they are never surprised that I was able to contact them. They <em>expect</em> that commenting makes their information available to the developer. Why wouldn't it?</p>

<h3>Mark as spam</h3>

<p>The only tool Google give developers to deal with comments is a spam/not-spam toggle. I don't think its appropriate to mark genuine comments (and I do think all of the above are genuine comments) as spam.</p>

<p>I understand this tool was added some time ago because there were big spam problems. So far I didn't get any spam comments at all.</p>

<h3>Paid vs Free</h3>

<p>Strangely, the users of paid apps are typically much more polite and less inclined to negatively review. They are more often inclined to email for help and delighted to get a response. </p>

<p>Could be its the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=principle%20of%20commitment&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CDcQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsumitdhar.blogspot.com%2F2005%2F09%2Finfluence-techniques-commitment.html&amp;ei=AhNET9KDG9OJhQfjl8XnBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8lIgMAPaBaWA2A1-D09qravE6Ew">Principle of Commitment</a> and maybe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-purchase_rationalization">Post-purchase Rationalisation</a> at work? Or maybe its just the demographic of free vs paid users?</p>

<p>I'm strongly considering never publishing a free app again, just for the reduced hassle.</p>

<h2>What Google can do to help developers</h2>

<p>I don't pretend to have all the answers, but a few small things would make my life as an Android developer much easier:</p>

<ul>
<li>Give developers access to the email address of commenters, or even a way to contact them via Google that keeps them anonymous. I imagine Google think that they are protecting users by anonymising them, but its really not helping anyone.</li>
<li>Allow threaded comments. That would be enough - if I could respond, and the commenter was alerted to the response, an awful lot of problems and misunderstandings could be cleared up quickly. This would be massively to Google's benefit, reducing user and developer frustration!</li>
<li>Include more device info in crash reports and comments (e.g. Android build versions and heap size for starters)</li>
<li>Maintain a list of device specs or emulator configurations that can be used to replicate crashes or bugs reported by users - including things like the damn heap size. I can't afford to buy one of every device on the market - my developer console states "This application is available to over 1245 devices.".</li>
</ul>

<p>Please Google, please just help us to help our users. Help us to make the Android eco-system better. Help us to generate more profits for you. Everyone wins.</p>

<p><em>p.s. I found a <a href="http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/android-market/feature-requests--suggestions/Ks4Eyg-UnpA">product-forums thread</a> on this topic where the originating comment dates back to May 2009 and raises many of the same points I've raised here. Clearly Google's priorities lie elsewhere :(</em></p>

	      <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>This post details my experiments parsing the same document with the usual-suspects - DOM, SAX, and Pull parsing - and comparing the results for readability and performance - especially for Android. The parsing mechanisms compared here are:</p>

<ol>
<li>W3C DOM parsing</li>
<li>W3C DOM and XPath</li>
<li>SAX Parsing</li>
<li>Pull Parsing</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/steveliles/dsl4xml">dsl4xml</a> (dsl around Pull-parser)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thebuzzmedia.com/software/simple-java-xml-parser-sjxp/">SJXP</a> (thin Pull-parser wrapper using xpath-like expressions)</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope to add more later - some contenders include: <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/index-140168.html">jaxb</a>; <a href="http://xstream.codehaus.org/">xstream</a>; and <a href="http://simple.sourceforge.net/">Simple</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/steveliles/dsl4xml-perf">code for the entire project</a> is in github. You will need to Maven install the <a href="https://github.com/steveliles/dsl4xml">dsl4xml</a> library if you want to run the tests yourself, as I'm afraid I don't have a public repo for it yet.</p>

<p><em>Important Note</em>: This experiment was inspired by some work I did to optimise a slow Android app, where the original authors had used mostly DOM parsing with a sprinkling of XPath. </p>

<p>My ultimate aim was to run these perf tests on one or more real Android devices and show how they compare there.</p>

<p>For this reason if you look at the project in github, you'll see that I've imported the Android 4 jar and used only the parser implementations that are available without additional imports in Android. (OK, the two pull-parser wrappers require very small standalone jars, sorry).</p>

<p>The Android project and Activity for running the tests on a device is in a separate project <a href="https://github.com/steveliles/dsl4xml-perf-android">here</a>.</p>

<h2>The XML</h2>

<p>The XML file being parsed is a Twitter search result (Atom feed). You can see the actual file <a href="https://github.com/steveliles/dsl4xml-perf/blob/master/src/main/java/com/sjl/dsl4xml/performance/model/twitter-atom.xml">here</a>, but this is a snippet of the parts I'm interested in parsing for these tests (the 15 <code>&lt;entry&gt;</code>'s in the document):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;feed .. &gt;
  ..
  &lt;entry&gt;
    ..
    &lt;published&gt;2012-04-09T10:10:24Z&lt;/published&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Tweet title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;content type="html"&gt;Full tweet content&lt;/content&gt;
    ..
    &lt;twitter:lang&gt;en&lt;/twitter:lang&gt;
    &lt;author&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;steveliles (Steve Liles)&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;uri&gt;http://twitter.com/steveliles&lt;/uri&gt;
    &lt;/author&gt;
  &lt;/entry&gt;
  ..
&lt;/feed&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>The POJO's</h2>

<p>The Java objects we're unmarshalling to are very simple and don't need any explanation. You can see them in Github <a href="https://github.com/steveliles/dsl4xml-perf/tree/master/src/main/java/com/sjl/dsl4xml/performance/model">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Parsing the Twitter/Atom feed</h2>

<p>First, just a few notes on what I'm trying to do. I basically want to compare two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Readability/maintainability of <em>typical</em> parsing code.</li>
<li>Parsing performance with said <em>typical</em> parsing code, incl. under concurrent load.</li>
</ol>

<p>With that in mind, I've tried to keep the parsing code small, tight, and (AFAIK) typical for each mechanism, but without layering any further libraries or helper methods on top. </p>

<p>In working with each parsing mechanism I have tried to choose more performant approaches where the readability trade-off is not high.</p>

<p>Without further ado, lets see what parsing this document and marshalling to Java objects is like using the various libraries.</p>

<h3>W3C DOM</h3>

<p>DOM (Document Object Model) parsing builds an in-memory object representation of the entire XML document. You can then rummage around in the DOM, going and back and forth between elements and reading data from them in whatever order you like.</p>

<p>Because the entire document is read into memory, there is an upper limit on the size of document you can read (constrained by the size of your Java heap). </p>

<p>Memory is not used particularly efficiently either - a DOM may consist of very many sparsely populated <code>List</code> objects (backed by mostly empty arrays). A side effect of all these objects in memory is that when you're finished with them there's a lot for the Garbage Collector to clean up.</p>

<p>On the plus side, DOM parsing is straight-forward to work with, particularly if you don't care much about speed and use <code>getElementsByTagName()</code> wherever possible.</p>

<p>The actual code I used for the performance test is <a href="https://github.com/steveliles/dsl4xml-perf/blob/master/src/main/java/com/sjl/dsl4xml/performance/parsers/DOMTweetsReader.java">here</a>, but this is roughly what it ended up looking like:</p>

<p>Its worth noting that I would normally extract some useful utility classes/methods - for example <code>getPCData(Node)</code> - but here I'm trying to keep the sample self-contained.</p>

<p>Note that this code is not thread-safe because of the unsynchronized use of <code>SimpleDateFormat</code>. I am using separate instances of the Reader classes in each thread for my threaded tests.</p>

<h3>W3C DOM and XPath</h3>

<p>XPath is a language for describing locations within an XML document as paths from a starting location (which can be the root of the document (/), the current location (.//) or anywhere (//)).</p>

<p>I've used XPath on and off for years, mostly in XSLT stylesheets, but also occasionally to pluck bits of information out of documents in code. It is very straight-forward to use.</p>

<p>Here's a sample for parsing our Twitter Atom feed. The <a href="https://github.com/steveliles/dsl4xml-perf/blob/master/src/main/java/com/sjl/dsl4xml/performance/parsers/DOMXPathTweetsReader.java">actual test code</a> is in github.</p>

<p>The code ends up being quite easy to read and can be written to nest in a way that mimics the document structure. There is a very big downside - as you'll see later - the performance is <em>atrocious</em>. </p>

<h3>SAX Parser</h3>

<p>SAX stands for Simple API for XML. It uses a "push" approach: whereas with DOM you can dig around in the document in whatever order you like, SAX parsing is event-driven which means you have to handle the data as it is given to you.</p>

<p>SAX parsers fire events when they encounter the various components that make up an XML file. You register a <code>ContentHandler</code> whose methods are called-back when these events occur (for example when the parser finds a new start element, it invokes the startElement method of your <code>ContentHandler</code>).</p>

<p>The API assumes that the consumer (<code>ContentHandler</code>) is going to maintain some awareness of its state (e.g. where it currently is within the document). I sometimes use a <code>java.util.Stack</code> to push/pop/peek at which element I'm currently working in, but here I can get away with just recording the name of the current element.</p>

<p>I'm extending <code>DefaultHandler</code> because I'm not interested in many of the events (it provides a default empty implementation of those methods for me).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/steveliles/dsl4xml-perf/blob/master/src/main/java/com/sjl/dsl4xml/performance/parsers/SAXTweetsReader.java">actual test code</a> is in github, and is actually more complex in order to handle entity-refs via a <code>LexicalHandler</code>,  but here's the gist of it:</p>

<pre><code>private XMLReader reader;
private TweetsHandler handler;

public SAXTweetsReader() 
throws Exception {
    SAXParserFactory _f = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();
    SAXParser _p = _f.newSAXParser();
    reader = _p.getXMLReader();
    handler = new TweetsHandler();
    reader.setContentHandler(handler);
}

@Override
public String getParserName() {
    return "SAX";
}

@Override

throws Exception {
    reader.parse(new InputSource(anInputStream));
    return handler.getResult();
}

private static class TweetsHandler extends DefaultHandler {

    private DateFormat dateFormat = 
        new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss");
    private Tweets tweets;
    private Tweet tweet;
    private Content content;
    private Author author;
    private String currentElement;

    public Tweets getResult() {
        return tweets;
    }

    @Override
    public void startDocument() throws SAXException {
        tweets = new Tweets();
    }

    @Override
    public void startElement(
        String aUri, String aLocalName, 
        String aQName, Attributes aAttributes
    ) throws SAXException {
        currentElement = aQName;
        if ("entry".equals(aQName)) {
            tweets.addTweet(tweet = new Tweet());
        } else if ("content".equals(aQName)) {
            tweet.setContent(content = new Content());
            content.setType(aAttributes.getValue("type"));
        } else if ("author".equals(aQName)) {
            tweet.setAuthor(author = new Author());
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void endElement(
        String aUri, String aLocalName, String aQName
    ) throws SAXException {
        currentElement = null;
    }

    @Override
    public void characters(char[] aCh, int aStart, int aLength)
    throws SAXException {
        if ("published".equals(currentElement)) {
            try {
                tweet.setPublished(dateFormat.parse(
                    new String(aCh, aStart, aLength))
                );
            } catch (ParseException anExc) {
                throw new SAXException(anExc);
            }
        } else if (
            ("title".equals(currentElement)) &amp;&amp;
            (tweet != null)
        ) {
            tweet.setTitle(new String(aCh, aStart, aLength));
        } else if ("content".equals(currentElement)) {
            content.setValue(new String(aCh, aStart, aLength));
        } else if ("lang".equals(currentElement)) {
            tweet.setLanguage(new String(aCh, aStart, aLength));
        } else if ("name".equals(currentElement)) {
            author.setName(new String(aCh, aStart, aLength));
        } else if ("uri".equals(currentElement)) {
            author.setUri(new String(aCh, aStart, aLength));
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One downside when handling more complicated documents is that the <code>ContentHandler</code> can get littered with intermediate state objects - for example here I have the <code>tweet</code>, <code>content</code>, and <code>author</code> fields.</p>

<p>Another is that SAX is very low level and you have to handle pretty much everything - including that text nodes are passed to you in pieces when there are entity-references present.</p>

<h3>Pull Parser</h3>

<p>Pull-parsing is the "pull" to SAX parsing's "push". SAX pushes content at you by firing events as it encounters constructs within the xml document. Pull-parsing lets you ask for (pull) the next significant construct you are interested in.</p>

<p>You still have to take the data in the order it appears in the document - you can't go back and forth through the document like you can with DOM - but you can skip over bits you aren't interested in.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/steveliles/dsl4xml-perf/blob/master/src/main/java/com/sjl/dsl4xml/performance/parsers/PullParserTweetsReader.java">Test code</a> is in github, this is roughly what it looks like:</p>

        if (_e == XmlPullParser.START_TAG) {
            startTag(aParser.getPrefix(), aParser.getName(), aParser);
        }
        _e = aParser.next();
    }

    return tweets;

private void startTag(String aPrefix, String aName, XmlPullParser aParser)
throws Exception {

<h3>SJXP (Pull-Parser wrapper)</h3>

<p>The first of the pull-parser <em>wrappers</em> under test, I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.thebuzzmedia.com/software/simple-java-xml-parser-sjxp/">this one</a> yesterday. I liked the idea behind it so decided to give it a try. </p>

<p>I'm a big fan of callbacks generally, and having spent quite some time working with XPath in the past the idea of using XPath-like syntax to request callbacks from the pull-parser seems tempting.</p>

<p>There was one problem I couldn't work around which seems like either a gap in my knowledge (and the documentation) or an irritating bug - when declaring the paths you have to use the full namespace uri <em>even on elements in the default namespace</em>. </p>

<p>This means that my path declarations even on this shallow document are enormous and I had to split them onto three lines to fit the width of my blog.</p>

<p>I like the idea of SXJP and I think that - particularly on more complex documents - it will lead to code that is easier to understand and maintain because you can consider each part entirely separately. It bulks up with boiler-plate though, especially with that namespace issue I mentioned.</p>

<p>Like SAX and "straight" Pull parsing it also suffers the problem of having to manage intermediate state (in my sample its <code>currentTweet</code>). It does allow a state/context object to be pushed into the callback methods, so I could have passed a customised context class to manage my state in instead of passing <code>Tweets</code>.</p>

<h3>dsl4xml (Pull-parser wrapper)</h3>

<p>Dsl4xml parsing code has a declarative style, is concise, and uses reflection to cut boiler-plate to a minimum.</p>

<li>The code is slightly unusual in its style because it uses an <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html">Internal Domain Specific Language</a>. The nice thing (IMHO) is that it is very readable, and even mimics the structure of the XML itself.</li>
</ol>

<p>Its still early days for dsl4xml, so the DSL may evolve a bit with time. I'm also looking into ways to keep the same tight syntax without resorting to reflection - the aim being to narrow the performance gap between the raw underlying parser (currently a Pull parser) and dsl4xml.</p>

<h2>Performance Comparison</h2>

<p>I built some performance tests using the mechanisms described above to parse the same document repeatedly. </p>

<p>The tests are run repeatedly with increasing numbers of threads, from 1 to 8, parsing 1000 documents in each thread. The xml document is read into a byte array in memory before the test starts to eliminate disk IO from consideration.</p>

<p>When the statistics for each method have been collected, the test generates a html document that uses Google charts to render the results.</p>

<p>Each parsing method is tested several times and the results averaged to smooth out some of the wilder outliers (still far from perfect, partly due to garbage collection). I ran the tests on my Linux Desktop, Macbook Air, Samsung Galaxy S2 and Morotola Xoom2 Media Edition. </p>

<p>Here is the chart for the desktop (Core i7 (quad) 1.8GHz, 4GB RAM, Ubuntu 11.10, Sun JDK 1.6.0-26). There is a noticeable hump at 4 threads, presumably because its a quad core. Performance keeps rising up to 8 threads, this presumably because the cpu has hyperthreading. After 8 threads the performance slowly drops off as the context-switching overhead builds up (not shown here):</p>

<p>And here's the chart from my MacBook Air (Core i5 (dual) 1.7GHz, 4GB RAM, OSX Lion, Apple JDK 1.6.0-31):</p>

<div id="laptop_chart_div"></div>

<p>The difference running under Android is, to put it mildly, astonishing. Here's the chart from my Samsung Galaxy S2 running Android 2.3.4, 64Mb heap. I reduced the max concurrency to 4 and the number of documents parsed per thread to 10, otherwise my phone would be obsolete before the results came back :)</p>

<div id="mobile_chart_div"></div>

<p>Yep, SAX kicking ass right there.</p>

<p>Here's how it looks on a Motorola Xoom 2 Media edition running Android 3.2.2 (with 48Mb heap):</p>

<p>Confirming that SAX is the way to go on Android!</p>

<h4>Quick side note about iOS</h4>

<p>My friend <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/prestonmr">Matt Preston</a> did a quick port of the <em>DOM</em> and <em>SAX</em> parsing tests to iOS. </p>

<p>He didn't produce a chart (yet!), but the <em>DOM</em> parsing throughput on an iPhone 4S was approximately twice as good as <em>SAX</em> parsing on my Samsung. SAX Parsing on the iPhone churned through on average 150 docs/sec!</p>

<p>Its interesting to note that the iPhone4S runs a 1GHz Cortex A9 CPU <em>clocked down</em> to 800Mhz, while my Samsung is running a <em>1.2GHz</em> Cortex A9.</p>

<h4>Why XPath parsing sucked so bad</h4>

<p>The observant will have noticed the charts do not contain figures for the XPath parsing. That's because I dropped it when I realised it was two orders of magnitude slower even than DOM parsing.</p>

<p>This appalling performance seems to be because when executing <em>each</em> xpath expression a context object is created which involves looking up several files on the classpath (and all the inherent synchronisation this entails). I don't intend to waste my time digging into why this can't done once and cached :(.</p>

<p>If you're interested, this is what my threads spent most of their time doing in the XPath test:</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<h3>Readability</h3>

<p>Of the mechanisms tested so far, and from the code samples above, I think that dsl4xml produces far the most readable and maintainable parsing code. Of course I am biased. </p>

<p>I think SAX parsing would have worked out to be the most readable of the other mechanisms if it hadn't been for those pesky entity-refs. As it is I have to recommend Pull-parsing as the way to go for readability.</p>

<h3>Desktop/laptop xml parsing performance</h3>

<p>SAX parsing and the pull-parsing wrappers give comparable performance. Raw Pull-parsing beats the lot by a margin of around 15%. DOM performs relatively badly - around twice as slow as any of the others. Don't go near XPath based parsing unless you like watching paint dry.</p>

<p>Recommendation: Pull Parser for max performance and relative ease of use. Dsl4xml if you want performance <em>and</em> great readability :)</p>

<h3>Android xml parsing performance</h3>

<p>Avoid XPath at all costs. DOM and pull-parsing appear to have similarly poor performance characteristics. SAX absolutely <em>destroys</em> all the others - roughly an order of magnitude quicker.</p>

<p>Recommendation: SAX, every time. I'll get working on a SAX-based dsl4xml implementation :)</p>

<p><em>Update (23rd April 2012): Just finished a SAX-based dsl4xml - here's the performance chart for my Samsung Galaxy SII again (also includes figures for SimpleXML):</em></p>

<div id="update_chart_div"></div>

<h3>Final words</h3>

<p>The Twitter Atom feed is not particularly complicated - tags are not deeply nested, not too many attributes, no nested tags of the same name, no mixed content (tags and text-nodes as siblings), etc. </p>

<p>I suspect that the performance gap between the different mechanisms widens as the document complexity increases, but as yet have no real evidence to back that up.</p>
