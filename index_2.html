  <p>Hi,</p>
  
  <p>Comic strip is a great app and i love it very much.
  But there are couple of problem</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>It force close when i apply FX</li>
  <li>When i preview the strip, the pictures turn out black</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Please fix it
  My handphone is samsung galaxy beam andriod 2.1</p>

<p>This user has paid for the "pro" version. He also added the following comment in the market:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2 stars) on February 18, 2012 (Samsung Galaxy Beam with version 1.5.0)
  It force close when i fx the pics and the pics turn out blank in the preview page..
  Will upgrade to 5 stars when fixed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting use of both carrot ("will upgrade to 5 stars"") and stick (current rating: 2 stars). I think the rating mechanism is pretty harsh on developers, but that's a topic for another post :)</p>

<h3>Black images in preview</h3>

<p>I started by looking into problem (2) - the black images in preview. This one sounded unusual - I've had no other reports of this problem at all.</p>

<p>I set up an Android 2.1 device in my emulator and set about trying to replicate the issue. I allowed it a 24Mb heap per app, and started to look into the black images in preview.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YVYANUbg_aU/T0DJhhXIbJI/AAAAAAAAI4o/Ur3jwiklV4Y/s800/Screen%2520Shot%25202012-02-19%2520at%252010.02.06.png" alt="Galaxy-Beam virtual device" /></p>

<p>I was pretty surprised to see that there was indeed a problem. In all my testing using other Android API levels I hadn't encountered any such issue. Every time I tried to re-load one of the images for preview I saw the following error in log-cat:</p>

<pre><code>Resolve uri failed on bad Bitmap uri: ...
</code></pre>

<p>The strange thing, of course, is that the uri was perfectly fine, works great in all API levels greater than 7, was created by the system using <code>Uri.fromFile(file)</code>, and is working fine even in API level 7 when I reload the image in the scene editor activity!</p>

<h3>Fix for "resolve uri failed on bad bitmap uri"</h3>

<p>Given that the scene-editor was able to load the image just fine, I compared the code I was using to load images in the scene-editor with the code in the preview-activity. I had the following:</p>

<pre><code>// scene-editor-activity snippet - works fine!
Bitmap _b = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(
    rslv.openInputStream(aScene.getBackgroundUri()), null, _opts
);
_img.setImageBitmap(_b);

// preview-activity snippet - fails with 'bad bitmap uri'
ImageView _image = new ImageView(ctx);  
_image.setImageURI(aScene.getBackgroundUri());
</code></pre>

<p>It seems that ImageView in Android versions less than 2.2 (API level 8) has a problem with directly resolving perfectly valid Bitmap uri's. </p>

<p>In the scene-editor I was always resolving the <code>Uri</code> to an <code>InputStream</code> using <code>ContentResolver</code> (which you can obtain from the Activity with <code>getContentResolver()</code>), whilst in my preview activity I was simply expecting ImageView to resolve the uri.</p>

<p>The fix for all Android versions was to use the slightly more laborious method of loading the Bitmap via <code>ContentResolver</code> and setting the <code>Bitmap</code> to the <code>ImageView</code>, like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Resolve a uri to a Bitmap
private Bitmap getImageBitmap(Uri aUri) {
    try {
        BitmapFactory.Options _opts = new BitmapFactory.Options();
        _opts.inScaled = false;
        _opts.inSampleSize = 1;
        _opts.inPreferredConfig = config;

        return BitmapFactory.decodeStream(
            rslv.openInputStream(aUri), null, _opts
        );
    } catch (Exception anExc) {
        L.e("loading bitmap", anExc);
        return null;
    }
}

// set a bitmap instead of a uri...
_image.setImageBitmap(getImageBitmap(aScene));
</code></pre>

<p>If the Uri really resolves to a missing file then I'll still get black images, but this is only likely in fairly extreme circumstances, and at least the app doesn't crash :). I suppose a better solution would be to return the app icon in such cases.</p>

<p>So to the next problem...</p>

<h3>Force-Close while applying FX</h3>

<p>My first guess was that this was going to be a VM budget issue. I've had them before, but with the v1.5.0 release I seemed to have largely solved them (no crash reports <em>at all</em> since). Here are some of the issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>Older Android devices only allow 16Mb to each running app. The generation of devices from about 2 years ago (e.g. original Motorola Droid) often allow 24Mb per app, which is still pretty small for dealing with large images. Current generation (e.g. Samsung Galaxy Mini and S2) allow 64Mb (yay!).</li>
<li>One of the nice things about Android devices is the way in which they integrate with Google's eco-system. For example, the "Gallery" app on most devices shows images from your Picasa Web Albums, as well as photos taken directly on the device. Of course, this means that the phone has access to potentially very large images taken with a "real" camera.</li>
<li>Many mobiles these days have 8MP camera's built in, therefore a single photo can be very large!</li>
<li>The nature of my app (making comic strips from your own images) means that I am dealing with potentially many images at any given time. Applying FX requires at least two such images concurrently in-memory (the source, and the target). The finished strips are rendered as rows of 350x350 images, so the size of that final bitmap depends on how many frames you add to your strip.</li>
</ol>

<p>A quick investigation revealed that I wasn't exceeding the VM budget - nowhere near in fact: the app crashed frequently with the VM size still less than 7Mb. Switching back and forth between API levels 7 and 8 showed that this was definitely only a problem at API level 7 (Android 2.1). </p>

<p>In 2.2 and above I can go through all of the FX several times over with no problems. In 2.1 the app usually crashes at the application of the second effect, but sometimes goes at the first or third attempt.</p>

<h3>SIGSEGV while recycling Bitmap's</h3>

<p>My app allows you to apply some image effects to the photos you select for each frame, to give a more comic-book feel. For example, you can apply a half-tone print effect, or a quantised and outlined "cartoon" effect.</p>

<p>To process these effects I have to juggle multiple <code>Bitmap</code>'s and <code>Canvas</code>'s, and - because of the resource-constrained environment of a mobile device - clean up the memory that these objects were using as soon as they are no longer needed.</p>

<p>To make the user-experience more friendly the FX are processed in a background thread. On the UI thread I show a dialog with a spinner to let the user know something is happening. This is nothing special - I'm using the <code>AsyncTask</code> class provided by the Android framework for exactly this purpose.</p>

<p>In Android - pre Honeycomb - Bitmap memory is allocated off-heap by JNI calls in the Bitmap class. It doesn't gain you extra memory to play with in your VM - the bitmap pixel data is still counted within the total memory used by your app (witness the number of StackOverflow questions pertaining to Bitmap's and VM budget!). In Honeycomb the bitmap pixel data has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CruQY55HOk">moved into the VM</a></p>

<p>As soon as you're done with a Bitmap, you are supposed to let the Runtime know, by invoking <code>Bitmap.recycle()</code>, then null'ing the reference to the Bitmap. Fine, my app works great on API levels above 7 - no crashes, no warnings, no memory leaks. </p>

<p>At API level 7 (Android 2.1) however, this is what happens:</p>

<p>Yep, that's a seg-fault of the Dalvik VM triggered in the libskia library (Android's graphics lib), so I'm pretty screwed here - there's no catch and recover strategy for that! I've tried all sorts of things to try to work around it for Eclair, but so far no joy. </p>

<p>I got quite a few hits on StackOverflow for similar problems. Most seemed to be related to calling recycle, but I often hit the problem even before I recycle - I get blow-outs when creating Bitmaps (and yes, I'm still well within the VM budget, and I even tried allowing a 64Mb heap per app).</p>

<p>This looks like a monstrous bug in Android-2.1 to me. If I can't work around it I'll refund my user (he's a user of the paid version), but I doubt if that will lead to recovery of my previously 4.8 star rating.</p>

<p>Did I mention that I thought the rating mechanism was pretty harsh on developers? :(</p>

<h3>Update - a few hours later :)</h3>

<p>After some more debugging, I isolated the problem and created the simplest re-construction possible. The following code crashes reliably under API level 7, but runs to completion under API level 8 or above:</p>

<pre><code>package com.roundwoodstudios.bitmaptest;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.graphics.Canvas;
import android.graphics.Color;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.util.Log;

public class BitmapActivity extends Activity {
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.main);

        for (int i=0; i&lt;100; i++) {
            Log.i("Bitmap Test", "Iteration: " + i);
            Canvas _c = new Canvas();
            _c.drawColor(Color.WHITE);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When you look at it like that its fairly clear what's wrong: the canvas isn't really initialised properly yet - it doesn't know how large it is, for example. If I set a bitmap to it <em>first</em> it runs fine even under API level 7:</p>

<pre><code>package com.roundwoodstudios.bitmaptest;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.graphics.Bitmap;
import android.graphics.Canvas;
import android.graphics.Color;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.util.Log;

public class BitmapActivity extends Activity {
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.main);

        for (int i=0; i&lt;100; i++) {
            Log.i("Bitmap Test", "Iteration: " + i);
            Canvas _c = new Canvas();
            Bitmap _b = Bitmap.createBitmap(350, 350, Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888);
            _c.setBitmap(_b);
            _c.drawColor(Color.WHITE);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Phew, that's a relief :)</p>

	      <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>As I mentioned in my previous post, I've been learning to use Gimp so I can produce icons for my apps. The most significant new finding for me has been the discovery of paths and how to use them in combination with selections.</p>

<p>The ability to use set operations to combine selections in different ways, and to remember selections as paths opens up a whole world of possibilities. Lets look at a really simple example:</p>

<p>Fire up the Gimp, and create a new image to work on. I'm going with a 512x512 canvas again. Choose the oval selection tool and draw an oval on your canvas, then hold down shift and draw another oval that overlaps the first a little. (I was already surprised that I could add to the selections like this actually!)</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-V7Kv9JeUjCg/TzogTnl5N9I/AAAAAAAAI3A/gdMgMCdWnAY/s800/Screen%2520Shot%25202012-02-14%2520at%252008.49.07.png" alt="multiple concurrent selections with gimp" /></p>

<p>Now, in the "Layers, Channels, Paths, .." window, open the paths tab, and click the "Selection to Path" icon (red circle with black lines above and below). You'll see a new entry added in the palette for your current selection shape. Here's how mine looks at this point:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DewiC7SQ5XY/TzohG7h9qHI/AAAAAAAAI3Y/QvwAoWgS4Sg/s800/Screen%2520Shot%25202012-02-14%2520at%252008.53.24.png" alt="gimp path dialog" /></p>

<p>There are immediately some neat things we can do:</p>

<ul>
<li>We can recreate this same selection at any time by selecting the path in the paths palette and clicking the "path to selection"" icon (the red square icon with dotted outline).</li>
<li>We can "Stroke" this path (draw around its outline), using the currently selected tool, brush and colour, by clicking the paint-brush icon on the paths panel.</li>
<li>We can add to or subtract from this selection using other selections, by drawing a new selection then holding down shift/ctrl/shift+ctrl and clicking the "path to selection" icon.</li>
<li>We can add hand-drawn shapes to our path by using the path tool to create them, then adding them to a selection as described above.</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing I found very useful, is that you can convert text to a path, which allows you to get creative with the stroke and fill used on that text. I'm going to clear my canvas and add some text:</p>

<ol>
<li>Select the text tool, click on the canvas and enter some text (I went with "Hello!")</li>
<li>Increase the font size so that the text just fits on the canvas (I'm using Trebuchet MS bold italic at 175px). You might have to grab the corners of the text selection and expand it so that you can see all of the text.</li>
<li>Move the text into the centre of the canvas.</li>
<li>On the tool window, in the section at the bottom containing the tool controls, look for a button  that says "Path from Text" - should be right at the bottom. Click it.</li>
<li>Open the paths dialog again (from the layers, channels, paths.. window) - you should see that you now have a path called "Hello!", which looks like an outlined version of your text.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now you can stroke and fill your text, convert it to a selection (allowing you to paint only inside or only outside), and generally do all kinds of neat things. For example:</p>

<ol>
<li>Switch to the "layers" dialog, and delete the floating text layer.</li>
<li>Switch back to the "Paths" dialog again, click the "path to selection" icon</li>
<li>Pick a nice colour to outline your text with (I've selected a deep blue)</li>
<li>Invert your selection (ctrl-i) - this is so that we only paint around the outside in the next step</li>
<li>From the "Paths" dialog, click the stroke icon</li>
<li>In the dialog that pops up, set the stroke width to be around 10. Because we are stroking the line at the edge of the selection, half of the stroke width falls inside the text outline and will not be painted because it isn't part of our current selection. Click OK to stroke the path.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now lets paint a gradient inside our text:</p>

<ol>
<li>From the "paths" dialog, click the "path to selection" icon</li>
<li>From the tool palette, select the gradient tool</li>
<li>Choose a foreground and background colour for the end-colours of your gradient (I'm going with red and yellow)</li>
<li>Click and hold the left button in the "H" of your text, then drag over to the "!" before letting go of the button. A gradient will be painted <em>inside</em> your text outline only.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the past I've fired it up to do all kinds of little jobs, but never really tried to use it to compose artwork of any complexity from scratch. That changed recently when I needed to create some nice icons for my Android app <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.roundwoodstudios.comicstripitpro">Comic Strip It!</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, and almost by accident, I've learned how to use paths, masks, and layers, as well as a few of the filters, and managed to turn out some icons that I'm not too embarrassed by! Here's some examples:</p>

<p>Since the app is all about creating comic strips I wanted icons that really fit with that idea, so I spent some time looking at comics and comic graphics. </p>

<p>The half-tone effect - coloured dots printed in rows at different sizes and angles to create the illusion of different shades of colour - figures heavily in print comic-books, and has a such a recognisable stylistic effect that I settled on using that as much as possible. My attempts at re-creating it aren't "real" half-tones, but I think the effect works.</p>

<h2>A few working practices</h2>

<p>I drew all my icons at 512x512 pixels, then re-scaled for use. Android wants 4 different sizes to cater for four different screen densities (low - 32x32, medium - 48x48, high - 72x72, extra-high - 96x96). </p>

<p>Drawing at the much larger size of 512x512 just makes it much easier to work, covers minor errors once you scale down, <em>and</em> means that you usually end up with a decent quality scaled image.</p>

<p>I save all the original icons using Gimp's native XCF file format, which retains the layers and masks and so on - this means I can always go back later and make small changes if I need to (and I did, many times).</p>

<p>Because my laptop runs Ubuntu I saved my icons in a folder shared by Ubuntu One (cloud backup and replication), but this didn't always work out well - connectivity issues on a few evenings meant that I got conflicting versions between my laptop and my desktop, and it wasn't too easy to sort out. </p>

<p>In future I will use <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>, as that puts control of when you update in your hands, and provides explicit versioning and access to old versions. I've upgraded to a paid <a href="http://www.github.com">github</a> account now that my app is live in the Android Market, and all my source-code lives there now.</p>

<p>So, to the icons...</p>

<h2>Creating a halftone background</h2>

<p>Almost all of my icons use a circular splash of half-tone colour as a background. It took me a good long time to figure out how to do this properly, but once you know how its done its actually very quick to re-create.</p>

<h4>Step 1: The background gradient</h4>

<p>First, create a new 512x512 file, and paint a linear gradient filling the entire image. To paint a gradient:</p>

<ol>
<li>select the "blend" tool, and make sure its send to "linear blend"</li>
<li>select foreground and background colours as the start and end colours for your gradient</li>
<li>hold down the left mouse-button in one corner of your image, move to the diagonally opposite corner and release the button to paint the gradient</li>
</ol>

<p>I picked a deep orange foreground colour, a paler orange-yellow background colour, and drew the gradient from bottom-left to top-right, resulting in the following image:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-RFRY_hGNiNs/Tzg2wBkpxyI/AAAAAAAAI1I/SiObSnce6wM/s800/halftone-background-step1.png" alt="step 1 - the background gradient" /></p>

<h4>Step 2: The half-tone mask</h4>

<p>To create the half-tone dot effect we're going to use one of Gimp's built in filters - "News-print". We want the dots to cluster heavily in the middle, then space further apart and get smaller the further they are from the centre of the image. Here's how we do that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new layer, above the existing colour gradient. I like to do that directly in the "Layers" palette by right-clicking and choosing "New Layer", making sure to select "Transparency" as the layer fill type, and give it a name (I usually call this layer "bg_halftone").</li>
<li>Make sure the layer is above your colour gradient in the layer palette. If it isn't, click and drag and drop it above the background layer.</li>
<li>Select the "blend" tool again, and choose full black as the foreground colour, and full white as the background colour. This time we want to do a "radial blend".</li>
<li>Move the mouse to the centre of your image, hold down the left button, and drag towards the right-hand edge. When you release the mouse you'll get a disc with a black centre, graduating through grey on a white background, as shown below.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-DVjmNBG53fw/Tzg56PUUREI/AAAAAAAAI1g/AousTkX7ozY/s800/halftone-background-step2.png" alt="black-to-white gradient disc" /></p>

<p>Now we're going to convert the smooth black-to-white gradient of our disc to a half-tone effect. We'll do that using the News-print filter:</p>

<ol>
<li>From Gimp's "Filters" menu, choose "Distorts -> Newsprint"</li>
<li>Increase the cell-size to something reasonably large - 25 to 30 works well if you're going to scale the final image down as I did. If you won't be scaling the image down, stick to something less than 10.</li>
<li>Visit the three colour channel tabs (red/green/blue) and set the same angle in all of them. I'm using 15 in this example.</li>
<li>Finally, set the anti-aliasing oversample to 15, and apply the filter.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jJ3x3SwAO10/Tzg7UDPi7RI/AAAAAAAAI14/gZLsPkiYrbo/s800/halftone-background-step3.png" alt="newsprint effect" /></p>

<h4>Step 3: Allowing the colour to shine through the mask</h4>

<p>Almost done! We just need to let the colour shine through from the background layer. I tried various ways of doing this. Masks worked well, and "Select->By Color" isn't bad (but does'nt capture anti-aliased areas perfectly). Eventually I got into the habit of a much simpler way:</p>

<ol>
<li>From Gimp's "Colors" menu choose "Color to Alpha"</li>
<li>Click the colour-box (from:) and select full black</li>
<li>Click OK and you'll see your background gradient shine through the dots</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note: If you noticed that the dots don't quite match up between the following image and the others on this page, its because I added this image after I originally posted, and had to re-create it because I had already deleted the .xcf file I originally used while writing this post. Oops.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-W8yUnXLKhWY/TzjVIugjWwI/AAAAAAAAI2o/BZIgOGNtrD8/s800/halftone-background-step4a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For completeness, here's the "Select->By Color" method, which I don't use any more because it involves more steps and leaves the dots with slightly jagged edges:</p>

<ol>
<li>From Gimp's "Select" menu, choose "By Color", and then select the white background of the image.</li>
<li>Invert the selection (ctrl-i) so that the black dots are now selected. (We could have selected the black dots initially, but I find that if you do this you end up with black artefacts after the next step)</li>
<li>From the "Edit" menu choose "Clear", or hit the delete key, if you have one (my laptop doesn't). You should now see the gradient colour from your background layer shining through the holes you just made in the top-most layer.</li>
<li>De-select (ctrl-a) and merge the two layers (right-click in the layers palette and choose "merge visible..")</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Kvxw_pqsjV0/Tzg-D_dIzXI/AAAAAAAAI2Q/egDujGmzQfg/s800/halftone-background-step4.png" alt="finished half-tone background" /></p>

<p>Notice that the edges of the dots in this version of the image are decidedly jagged, compared to the version created by using the colour-to-alpha technique. This is to do with the select-by-colour method not including anti-aliasing pixels that are closer to white than black in the selection.</p>

<h4>Step 4: Optional - de-focus for use as a background</h4>

<p>I used this technique to create the backgrounds for my icons, adding one more step: gaussian blur to de-focus the background and make the foreground icon stand out nice and sharp.</p>

<p>I used the same technique to pattern-fill the icon detail by using paths and selections. I'll save the details of that for another post.</p>

	      <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>Icons for iOS apps are generally provided by the app with square corners and no "sheen". The rounded corners and glossy sheen are added by iOS.</p>

<p>If you want to achieve the iOS icon look on icons used elsewhere (Android, Web, etc), you need to round the corners and apply the sheen yourself.</p>

<p>What follows is my quick attempt to give the iOS treatment to this 512x512 icon:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-UaUMm3U99L8/TyLi2QD6E-I/AAAAAAAAIq4/gl-21ZMoBg4/s800/in.png" alt="Original Icon" /></p>

<h3>Transparent Rounded Corners</h3>

<p>OK, transparent rounded corners are actually the easy part. There are several ways to get ImageMagick to do this. The easiest (read: shortest) command i've found looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>convert -size 512x512 xc:none -fill white -draw \
    'roundRectangle 0,0 512,512 50,50' in.png \
    -compose SrcIn -composite rounded.png
</code></pre>

<p>So now we have this:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ndvucr5orZ4/TyLmOX_XYqI/AAAAAAAAIrc/gMdrV_Hvil8/s800/test.png" alt="Rounded Corners" /></p>

<h3>Overlay some sheen</h3>

<p>The sheen is trickier. I imagine that real ImageMagick pro's could generate the sheen mask with some deft command-line, but I'm nowhere near that proficient.</p>

<p>Instead I created the following image in Gimp - exactly how is a topic for another post :). The black background is coming from the div containing the image - where you see black is actually transparent in my png, and the grey highlight at the top is semi-transparent:</p>

<div style="background-color:black; width:512px;"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gssBzUQ5a0c/TyLi4f6F6fI/AAAAAAAAIrE/Lc9HhdfRQN8/s800/gloss-over.png"></div>

<p>To composite the rounded-corner image with the glossy overlay (gloss-over.png), I use this ImageMagick command:</p>

<pre><code>convert -draw "image Screen 0,0 0,0 'gloss-over.png'" \
    rounded.png final.png
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-YaXSMS3j_Ws/TyLmvOKZLMI/AAAAAAAAIr0/h_nP4EQ8k94/s800/final.png" alt="Final iOS style image" /></p>

	      <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>Invoking an external process from Java appears easy enough but there are sooo many gotchas to watch out for. Typical problems that arise include:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Hanging Processes</em> - The invoked process "hangs" and never completes (because it is waiting for input that never comes, or for the output buffer(s) to be drained).</li>
<li><em>Failure to execute</em> - Commands that work fine from the cmdline refuse to run when invoked from Java (because the parameters are passed incorrectly).</li>
<li><em>Mysterious issues in production</em> - Peculiar situations where processes cease to work after running happily for some time (the file-handle quota is exhausted because the IO streams are not being correctly closed).</li>
</ol>

<p>The first two are irritating, but at least they present themselves immediately and are typically fixed before the code leaves the developer. </p>

<p>The last problem is much more insidious and often only rears its head after some time in production (sometimes this is because it takes time and a significant number of executions before it manifests, other times it is because of differences between the development and production environments).</p>

<p>Lets have a look at the general solution to each of these problems. Later I'll list some code that I've been using to invoke processes safely.</p>

<h3>Hanging Processes</h3>

<p><em>Symptoms:</em> When invoked, the process starts but does not complete. Sometimes this may appear to be caused by the input that is being fed to the process (e.g. with input A it works but with input B it does not), which adds to the confusion over why the problem occurs.</p>

<p><em>Cause:</em> The most common reason for this problem is failing to pump input into the program, and drain output buffers from the program, using separate threads.</p>

<p>If a program is consuming sufficient input via standard-input (stdin), or producing sufficient output via stdout or stderr, the limited buffers available to it will fill up. Until those buffers are drained the process will block on IO to those buffers, so the process is effectively hung.</p>

<p><em>Solution:</em> When you invoke any process from Java, you must use separate threads to pump data to/from stdin, stdout, and stderr:</p>

<pre><code>// invoke the process, keeping a handle to it for later...
final Process _p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("some-command-or-other");

// Handle stdout...
new Thread() {
    public void run() {
    try {
            Streams.copy(_p.getInputStream(), System.out);
        } catch (Exception anExc) {
            anExc.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}.start();

// Handle stderr...
new Thread() {
    public void run() {
    try {
            Streams.copy(_p.getInputStream(), System.out);
        } catch (Exception anExc) {
            anExc.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}.start();
</code></pre>

<p>Correctly pumping data into and out of the std io buffers will keep your processes from hanging.</p>

<h3>Failure to communicate</h3>

<p><em>Symptoms:</em> You have a command-line that works perfectly when executed at the shell prompt, but invoking it from Java results in strange errors and, perhaps, complaints about invalid parameters.</p>

<p><em>Cause:</em> Typically this occurs when you try to pass parameters which include spaces - for example file-names - which you escape or quote at the shell prompt.</p>

<p><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-khRgW4ViBts/TyM8-x7BVZI/AAAAAAAAIsQ/2IiEhj5GdkA/s1600/27.jpg"><img alt="Java invoking ImageMagick - a lego comic strip created with Comic Strip It! for Android" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-khRgW4ViBts/TyM8-x7BVZI/AAAAAAAAIsQ/2IiEhj5GdkA/s600/27.jpg"></a></p>

<p><em>Example:</em> Running ImageMagick "convert" to add transparent rounded corners to an icon:</p>

<pre><code>convert -size 72x72 xc:none -fill white -draw \
  'roundRectangle 0,0 72,72 15,15' in.png \
  -compose SrcIn -composite out.png
</code></pre>

<p>This command-line works fine at a bash prompt, but if you try to invoke it naively from Java it will likely fail in a variety of interesting ways depending on your platform:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String... anArgs) {
    // invoke the process, keeping a handle to it for later...
    final Process _p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(
        "/usr/bin/convert -size 72x72 xc:none -fill white -draw" +
        " 'roundRectangle 0,0 72,72 15,15' /home/steve/Desktop/in.png" +
        " -compose SrcIn -composite /home/steve/Desktop/out.png"
    );

    // Handle stdout...
    new Thread() {
        public void run() {
            try {
                Streams.copy(_p.getInputStream(), System.out);
            } catch (Exception anExc) {
                anExc.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }.start();

    // Handle sderr...
    new Thread() {
        public void run() {
            try {
                Streams.copy(_p.getErrorStream(), System.out);
            } catch (Exception anExc) {
                anExc.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }.start();

    // wait for the process to complete
    _p.waitFor();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Whilst the command-line worked fine at the bash prompt, running the same command from Java results in an error message!:</p>

<pre><code>convert: non-conforming drawing primitive definition 
    `roundRectangle' @ error/draw.c/DrawImage/3143.
convert: unable to open image `0,0':  @ error/blob.c/OpenBlob/2489.
convert: unable to open image `72,72':  @ error/blob.c/OpenBlob/2489.
convert: unable to open image `15,15'':  @ error/blob.c/OpenBlob/2489.
convert: non-conforming drawing primitive definition 
    `roundRectangle' @ error/draw.c/DrawImage/3143.
</code></pre>

<p>What's going on!? Basically the command we gave to Runtime.exec has been sliced up at spaces, ignoring the single quotes, and so ImageMagick has seen a very different command-line to the one we presented via the shell.</p>

<p><em>Solution:</em> The solution this time is very easy: Use the overloaded Runtime.exec(..) methods that accept the command <em>and</em> the parameters as an array of String's. Re-writing our previous example:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String... anArgs) 
throws Exception {
    // invoke the process, keeping a handle to it for later...
    // note that we pass the command and its params as String's in
    // the same String[]
    final Process _p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(
        new String[]{
            "/usr/bin/convert",
            "-size", "72x72", "xc:none", "-fill", "white", "-draw",
            "roundRectangle 0,0 72,72 15,15", 
            "/home/steve/Desktop/in.png", "-compose", "SrcIn",
            "-composite", "/home/steve/Desktop/out.png"
        }
    );

    // Handle stdout...
    new Thread() {
        public void run() {
            try {
                Streams.copy(_p.getInputStream(), System.out);
            } catch (Exception anExc) {
                anExc.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }.start();

    // Handle sderr...
    new Thread() {
        public void run() {
            try {
                Streams.copy(_p.getErrorStream(), System.out);
            } catch (Exception anExc) {
                anExc.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }.start();

    // wait for the process to complete
    _p.waitFor();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Passing your cmdline parameters in a String array instead of as one long String should prevent your parameters from being chewed up and mis-interpreted.</p>

<h3>Mysterious issues in production</h3>

<p><em>Symptoms:</em> For a good while things appear to be working fine. Processes are invoked, do their work, and shut-down. After a while a problem occurs - the processes are no longer being invoked, or hang.</p>

<p><em>Cause:</em> The cause of this is usually exhaustion of the available file-handles, which in turn is caused by failing to correctly close all of the IO streams opened to handle the process IO.</p>

<p><em>Solution:</em> Careful closure of all standard IO streams opened by the process <em>and</em> streams opened by you to consume the data from the standard streams opened by the process. Note: That's SIX streams in total, not just the three that you open to deal with stdin, stdout and stderr! I also recommend calling <code>destroy</code> on the Process object.</p>

<p>I <em>may</em> be being over-cautious in closing the process's own std streams, but I have seen many cases where closing these streams solved problems of leaked file-handles. (btw., A handy tool if you're running a *nix is <code>lsof</code>, which lists open file handles).</p>

<p>Here's how I recommend cleaning up after your process completes (this assumes that you did provide input via stdin):</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String... anArgs) {
    Process _process = null;
    InputStream _in = null;
    OutputStream _out = null;
    OutputStream _err = null;
    try {
        _process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec( ... );
        // ... don't forget to initialise in, out, and error,
        // .... and consume the streams in separate threads!
        _process.waitFor();
    } finally {
        if( _process != null ) {
            close(_process.getErrorStream());
            close(_process.getOutputStream());
            close(_process.getInputStream());
            _process.destroy();
        }
        close(_in);
        close(_out);
        close(_err);
    }
}

private static void close(InputStream anInput) {
    try {
        if (anInput != null) {
            anInput.close();
        }
    } catch (IOException anExc) {
        anExc.printStackTrace();
    }
}

private static void close(OutputStream anOutput) {
    try {
        if (anOutput != null) {
            anOutput.close();
        }
    } catch (IOException anExc) {
        anExc.printStackTrace();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>These days I usually use some utility classes which I've written to wrap all this stuff up and make life a little easier. You can find them in my <a href="https://github.com/steveliles/sjl.io">sjl.io</a> project at github. There's an example of usage in the <code>test</code> source tree - <code>ExternalProcessTest</code> - which invokes ImageMagick.</p>
